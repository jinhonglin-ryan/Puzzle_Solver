*Running the Program*

The program executable should be named “puzzle”.

There are two ways to invoke the program. If invoked without command line arguments,
./puzzle
then the program should read commands from stdin.

If the program is invoked with a single argument, e.g.
./puzzle input.txt
then the program should read commands from the file named by the command line argument.


*Input Format*

Command	                Description
C size	                Create initial puzzle with size rows and columns
T tile...	            Initialize puzzle configuration with series of tile numbers
I filename	            Load the background image from specified PPM file
P	                    Print sequence of tile numbers reflecting current puzzle configuration
W filename1 filename2	Write puzzle image to filename1 and puzzle configuration to filename2
S direction	            Slide a free tile in specified direction
K	                    Check to see whether the puzzle is in the “winning” configuration
V	                    Compute a series of moves to solve the puzzle
Q	                    Quit the program




*Testing*
The files test01.txt through test09.txt are example inputs. The corresponding example outputs, generated image files, and generated puzzle configuration files are found in the “expected” directory. When you run your puzzle executable on the example inputs, you can compare the generated outputs to the expected files. The compare and diff programs are useful for comparing images and text files. Here is a scenario in which you could run your puzzle program on the test06.txt input and compare the results (note that “$” is used to indicate the command prompt, and the compare commands are on two lines, with the \ character being used as a line continuation):

$ ./puzzle test06.txt > test06_out.txt
$ diff expected/test06_out.txt test06_out.txt
$ compare expected/ingo_scrambled_test06.ppm ingo_scrambled_test06.ppm \
	ingo_scrambled_test06_diff.png
$ diff expected/ingo_scrambled_test06.txt ingo_scrambled_test06.txt
$ compare expected/ingo_solved_test06.ppm ingo_solved_test06.ppm \
	ingo_solved_test06_diff.ppm
$ diff expected/ingo_solved_test06.txt ingo_solved_test06.txt
