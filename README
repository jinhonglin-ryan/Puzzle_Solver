*Running the Program*

The program executable should be named “puzzle”.

There are two ways to invoke the program. If invoked without command line arguments,
./puzzle
then the program should read commands from stdin.

If the program is invoked with a single argument, e.g.
./puzzle input.txt
then the program should read commands from the file named by the command line argument.


*Input Format*

Command	                Description
C size	                Create initial puzzle with size rows and columns

I filename	            Load the background image from specified PPM file
P	                    Print sequence of tile numbers reflecting current puzzle configuration
W filename1 filename2	Write puzzle image to filename1 and puzzle configuration to filename2
S direction	            Slide a free tile in specified direction
K	                    Check to see whether the puzzle is in the “winning” configuration
V	                    Compute a series of moves to solve the puzzle
